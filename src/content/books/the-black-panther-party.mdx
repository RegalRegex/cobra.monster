# Synopsis

Via the medium of graphic novel, Walker and Anderson deliver a thorough-yet-abbreviated history of the American Black Panthers Party, from rise to fall. The book mostly follows the Party chronologically, but takes tasteful diversions to focus on key individuals.

<span className="text-2xl">**4.5 / 5 Overall**</span>

An incredible work, extremely successful in its mission with respectful-but-impactful artistic depictions of incredible freedom fighters. My only wish was for more details within the various anecdotes and biographies, which are largely supplied by other works (e.g. the incredible *Assata* and *Blood in my Eye* by Assata Shakur and George Jackson, respectively), but as this is a personal rating, I feel it's fair to say that my only complaint is that I wanted more.

# Recommendation
Incredibly easy recommendation to nearly anyone, but especially fellow White Americans.\
I bought this book explicitly for both self-knowledge, and to vet it as a potential recommendation to aspiring Leftist/Communist peers who need an accessible look into the history of America's most successful radical party to-date. <InlineEmoji emoji='triumph' />
