summary: '"Pedestrian" in name only, this is an exceptional cafe. A beautiful shop space packed with high-effort, quality coffee and food items, all made in-house. Offerings change often as the owner tries out new ideas and products, but the coffee fundamentals are rock-solid. One of the best places in town for a consistent espresso or pour-over.'
orderSuggestion: An Americano with their premium single-origin espresso option

**Note:** If there's any cafe in the city in which I'm a "regular", it's this one. I've been frequenting here since I moved to Chicago in 2022, and have even been invited to employee parties as a guest.\
I have a lot of thoughts, most of them very positive about this shop! But do know that I am absolutely getting special treatment in terms of service here, coloring my review...but also offering some insider-insight since I'm friends with folks outside of the cafe environment :3

## Coffee

![White diner-style coffee mug that says "Estd 2019 PEDESTRIAN COFFEE"](IMG_1863.jpg 'tbh I hate these types of mugs lmao. Don\'t know why, they\'re just so thick!')
_Their logo is so simple and good!_

Absolutely top-tier coffee. 9/10 because they don't tend to have the crazy funky stuff that I only find in the most niche, insane-specialty shops, but don't get it twisted, this is GREAT coffee.

Pedestrian roasts all their own coffee and they're pretty damn good at it. Large enough batches that if you like a brew, you'll have access to it for a good while. The owner, Tim, is a stickler for quality and consistency, and I think that plays to tremendous strength here.

### Espresso

Their default espresso blend is called *The Jaywalker* (very cute) and it's a perfectly inoffensive carry-all espresso. Great as an americano, great in milk drinks, and honestly even worth getting as straight espresso.\
Their *single-origin* (offered as a $2 up-charge) is something altogether different though. Crazy tasty. Crazy good. The only weakness it has is that it's ordered infrequently enough that its quality that day is dependent on the barista on bar at that moment, and whether they have the time (or interest) in ensuring it's dialed in perfectly.

<EmojiBlockquote size="sticker" emoji={Argent_uwu}>
First "special treatment" note: every time I've ordered a rare espresso (i.e. the $2 single-origin or the decaf espresso), the baristas on staff have made a point to pull test shots until it's perfected.\
I know they do this for others, but I'm fairly certain they take extra care for me <InlineEmoji emoji={purple_heart}/>

On top of solid espresso, they have rockin' syrups and latte drinks. A favorite order of mine is a *12oz decaf Cardamom Rose latte*. The syrups are just insane, but the baristas are also genuinely very good at steaming and preparing the milk, so it's always a great experience.

### Pour-over

This is what really drew me to Pedestrian in the first place: they're one of the rare Chicago coffee shops offering pour-overs! And damned good ones.\
They're V60 pour-overs prepped on the bar seating area that I love to sit and work at, so you get a bit of a show (and chance to socialize) while they brew :3

Tim, the owner, is anal about training baristas for pour-overs, and it seems to be one of the last tasks they're allowed to perform upon hire, and I appreciate the dedication to recipe (and skill expression) consistency.

The pour-over offerings rotate on a 4-6 month cycle, generally offering 3 types of coffee:

1. A classic, nutty-profile South American coffee
2. A fruity African coffee
3. Decaf Colombia

Pretty good spread! One time they offered a $9 pour-over of a Mexico Chiapas-region *Gesha* coffee and it fucking ruled. I still miss it.

### Drip &c.

Keeping it short and sweet: also awesome. I just prefer espresso and americanos, but awesome!

## Cafe

Possibly the best cafe space I've yet found in Chicago. Subjective, sure...but here are some facts to prove my point:

- literally next-door to the Belmont red/brown/purple L station
- connected to Devil Dawgs (shared bathroom)
- varied seating: short bar, high bar, shared tables, cafe tables, chair seating, couch seating, and even a solo corner 'study desk'
- climber plants all over the lights and ceiling (Danny is the GOAT for maintaining those beauties!)
- baking done in shop, so you get fresh coffee and fresh pastry smell
- outlets built into all bars and shared tables

I'll get into more detail in the *Productivity* section, but the cafe gets a 5/5 because it's large enough and varied enough to suit nearly any visit circumstance (social, working, casual, etc.)

## Price

Not cheap, but also not unfairly expensive, I'd say. As of *3 November, 2025* most 12oz lattes are ~$7. Americanos are about $5. Pour over is between $6.50 and $8.

Minus points for a no-cash policy too :/

## Productivity

Pedestrian is peak, here. Because this is my *home base* coffee shop, I'll break it down a little more than usual.

### Drawing

For me, drawing at a coffee shop depends on three things:

1. Table height (drawing comfort)
2. "Traffic flow" (i.e. how often are folks walking by me while I'm drawing)
3. Noise/distraction level

Pedestrian hits a sweet spot on all 3 of these, personally. Especially for table height. The shared tables are the perfect drawing height, and the high-bars are ideal for both seated and standing drawing!

### Socializing

Just so solid overall. Invite someone or a group to hang with you here and not only will folks 100% guaranteed find something they want on the menu, but there's nearly always ample space for groups of 4 or smaller.\
Volume is chill enough that you can comfortably hold conversations...just good!

### Laptop work

A+. Great wifi, outlets on the walls and built into the tables, and pretty privacy options for folks who want to be in corners or with their screen to a wall.\
Moreover, it's very comfortably a cafe where you can either work on a laptop in silence, or socialize with friends, and no matter what you won't feel like the only one at the cafe doing so.

## Vibes

This is where things get a little awkward. 4/5 because on the whole, this cafe is comfy, fun, chill, overall just a great experience. Unless you only have cash, you're 99/100 times going to feel safe, comfy, and have a great cafe experience here.

There are 3 concerns pulling a point away from Pedestrian, which I won't go into exhaustive detail about here but suffice to say:

1. Past labor concerns: I've been assured this has improved as of late, but concurrently in the past wages were very low and workloads/expectations very high.
2. Treatment of unhoused: Much more I could say but TL;DR if employees are going to be trained to shoo unhoused folks out of the shop, I think the shop could spare to offer them a cup of coffee or a day-old pastry at least...
3. Bad Macro Business: the owner has bought/leased other commercial spaces that aren't doing nearly as well, draining this Lakeview location of both profit and team morale. I have some sympathy because the Lakeview location is really 1 in a million.
