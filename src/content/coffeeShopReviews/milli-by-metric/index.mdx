summary: An experimental cafe space designed by the folks at Metric to serve coffee, in-house pastries, and eventually wine, Milli is a huge, gorgeous cafe space serving excellent coffee. The worst that can be said about it is that it may be *too* popular, because it can be hard to find a table despite the large footprint.
orderSuggestion: Any pour-over

## Coffee

<EmojiBlockquote size='sticker' emoji={Argent_Uwu}>Metric is one of the larger Chicago-local coffee roasters you'll find served in cafes around the city.[^1] And while I love Intelligentsia's single-origin offerings, I think as a "daily driver" for cafes Metric is the all-around best. </EmojiBlockquote>

Milli serves some damn awesome coffee here. Metric is putting out their very best for this cafe and you can really tell. I haven't visited enough to form a comprehensive opinion of their offerings. So far though I've been impressed by their pour-overs, cortados, and espresso. So that's a pretty solid win so far!

[^1]: In my opinion, the big 4 are: **Metric**, **Dark Matter**, **Intelligentsia**, and **Metropolis**

## Cafe

This is where this place truly shines. The cafe design is *incredible.* An overall warmth from the sheer amount of wood built into the walls, ceiling, and decor. The theming is consistent throughout the whole building, imparting a sort of largeness of the project, but also the grounded coziness that you expect from a coffee shop.

The first things I really noticed in there were the saturated blue and orange tables. They're neat! And then after that I noticed these absolutely massive jade plants...! Good heavens.
