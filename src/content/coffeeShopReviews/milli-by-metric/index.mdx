summary: An experimental cafe space designed by the folks at Metric to serve coffee, in-house pastries, and eventually wine, Milli is a huge, gorgeous cafe space serving excellent coffee. The worst that can be said about it is that it may be *too* popular, because it can be hard to find a table despite the large footprint.
orderSuggestion: Any pour-over

## Coffee

Milli serves some damn awesome coffee here. Metric is putting out their very best for this cafe and you can really tell. I haven't visited enough to form a comprehensive opinion of their offerings. So far though I've been impressed by their pour-overs, cortados, and espresso. So that's a pretty solid win so far!

<EmojiBlockquote size='sticker' emoji={Argent_Uwu}>Metric is one of the larger Chicago-local coffee roasters you'll find served in cafes around the city.[^1] And while I love Intelligentsia's single-origin offerings, I think as a "daily driver" for cafes Metric is the all-around best. </EmojiBlockquote>

[^1]: In my opinion, the big 4 are: **Metric**, **Dark Matter**, **Intelligentsia**, and **Metropolis**

## Cafe

![Wide shot of the main cafe area. From the top left, wooden boards and ceiling panels. Below are small windows into the roastery, sealed off from the cafe space. People will blurred faces are seated at 3 varieties of seating, all with treated wooden and metal chairs. In the foreground there are saturated blue & orange cafe tables](<image copy 12.png> "It's such a gorgeous cafe space")
_Anyone walking into this room immediately comprehends the full value of this cafe_

This is where this place truly shines. The cafe design is *incredible.* An overall warmth from the sheer amount of wood built into the walls, ceiling, and decor. The theming is consistent throughout the whole building, imparting a sort of largeness of the project, but also the grounded coziness that you expect from a coffee shop.

The first things I really noticed in there were the saturated blue and orange tables. They're neat! And then after that I noticed these absolutely massive jade plants...! Good heavens.

The ceiling has a swirled brown design on orange. The light is a rectangular "tube" with protrusions giving a 70s aesthetic. The espresso bar is warmly lit with orange lights.](<image copy 3.png> "Almost mad how busy this place is lol I just want to go in and bask in the vibes but I'm constantly standing int he way of someone haha")
_Best first impression I've had in a cafe ever._

The entryway is so perfectly designed to be effective AND impactful. The vibes are incredible.

I think the queue area could use a little work, but mostly because I don't think they anticipated how popular this place would be.

There is an archway in the back leading to more of the cafe. There's a bussing station in the foreground on the left. A zz plant. And on the right the barista table is visible.](<image.png>)
_The entryway is usually decently loud--haven't sat there yet but it's still nice!_

## Price

_They bake all their pastries in-house and they always look incredible_

Pretty much exactly what I expect, price-wise. Things fluctuate with rotating offerings.\
Expect to pay a tiny bit above average prices for normal things like Americanos or Drip, with optional $2+ surcharges for single-origin upgrades.

| Drink Type ("M") | Price (USD) |
| -------- | --------- |
| Drip     | $4.50     |
| Latte    | $6.00     |
| Cortado  | $4.50     |
| Americano| $4.00     |
| Mocha    | $6.75  (flat +$0.75 for any syrup)|
| Pour Over| $7.00 - $9.00|
| Draft Cold Brew | $6.00 |

## Productivity

![Immaculate latte in a white & red mug, on an orange table, beside a book titled "Black Scare / Red Scare"](<image copy 7.png> "I'm not a latte guy, but decaf mochas are a great way to get tasty coffee when I can't have any caffeine :,)")
_Just happened to have the perfect book to match this latte!_

Beautiful as this cafe is, its productivity value somewhat collapses under its own weight...The cafe is so beautiful, fun, and approachable that it is impossibly busy all of the time.

Both times I've gone I was able to get a table...but only just barely. It is not uncommon to see people sitting on benches, laptops perched on their laps waiting for a table.

It's also very loud. The acoustics aren't great for taking calls or focusing on a book--if you're going to be there, it should be to socialize (unless you have good noise-canceling headphones).

![View of a hallway leading to the roastery area, as well as the restrooms. A zz plant is visible in the foreground.](<image copy 5.png>)
_Good example of the kind of acoustics you can expect from the walls here_

Outlet availability isn't great either--they have 4 huge tables against the roastery wall, and so far as I can tell those are the only tables with outlet access.\
They're always taken.

## Vibes

_Love the juxtaposition of 'old warehouse' and 'renovated retro space' vibes_

If not obvious by now, vibes are fantastic here. Literally my only complaint is how busy it is, and you really can't fault them for that.

Fresh food, fantastic coffee, a beautiful space, AND a roastery separated from the cafe space. Just fantastic. The neighborhood really needed a good, big space like this and I'm glad they got it.
