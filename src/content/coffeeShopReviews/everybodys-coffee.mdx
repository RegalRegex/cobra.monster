summary: Community art + zines, and high-quality-yet-cheap single-origin drip coffee
---

## Coffee

Very solid overall. Single-origin drip is consistently fantastic, even as they rotate out. Easy all-day drinking.\
Espresso unremarkable, and no pour-overs.

## Cafe

"Utilitarian-but-cozy". No couches, armchairs, but great seating variety and the natural wood theme feels consistent. Space can be a little loud/echoey. Outdoor seating limited but nice. Feels intentionally-designed.

## Price

$2.77 for a 12oz single-origin drip is impossible to beat. Other coffee drinks are fairly priced.

## Productivity

Great productivity vibes here. Plentiful spacing, and many outlets available for use. High tables have especially courteous outlet routing for good access. Generally quiet, good wifi.

## Vibes

Feels like community, and feels like a safe space. Staff seem to enjoy the space, and their joy + the wall art make the place feel lively and local.
