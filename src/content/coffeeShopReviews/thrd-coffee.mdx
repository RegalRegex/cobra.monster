## Coffee

Insanely good all around. Espresso is always an interesting single-origin roast, consistently dialed-in perfectly. Get a 6oz Americano or smaller (Cortado, Macchiato, espresso) to really taste its quality. Can't go wrong.\
Pour-overs feature rotating selection of single-origin coffees, often very cool funky anaerobic and fruit-forward roasts.\
Drip coffee is fantastic too, just hard to choose over espresso or pour-overs haha.

Overall just unbelievable quality.

## Cafe

It's a pretty unremarkable building space that they've done an amazing job rehabbing with local artist wall murals, plants, good seating variety, and overall nice vibes. Good for productive work, but I wouldn't call it at all cozy.

Outdoor space is limited (sidewalk) but often available. Previously had some pretty flimsy folding chair seating, but when I alerted them to the poor repair of the seating (screws came loose), they replaced them the next day with more solid furniture.

## Price

You literally cannot get a better price for this quality of coffee. I asked the owner about it, and the philosophy amounts to a genuine hope of offering high-quality coffee to the community at accessible prices. I always tip the max here! <InlineArgentEmoji emoji="smirk"/>

## Productivity

Top-tier productivity here. Good volume, solid wifi, and plentiful outlet access. Tables are huge, and seats are solid and comfy for long-sittings. I've gotten a lot of work and art done here.

## Vibes

Not the kind of place you'll immediately fall in love with, but give it a chance. The coffee is obviously a stand-out, but the unconventional cafe space will grow on you once you've visited a time or two.
