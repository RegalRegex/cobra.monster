summary: Huge cafe-roastery with a wide variety of both coffee offerings and seating options. A great place to get some work done, or meet friends without compromising an inch on specialty coffee quality. However it can get very loud and overstimulating, especially on weekends, so plan accordingly.
orderSuggestion: Pour-over or Espresso, depending on that day's offering

A very unique cafe in a unique part of town (not necessarily unique in a "good" way). While I've enjoyed my time here, it will likely not become a super-regular location for me. And I can't help but wonder how much of its foot traffic success is due to the recent closing of the nearby Starbucks.

## Coffee

![A pour-over served on an oval wooden tray. The cup on the left is a small grey and dark wood cup. On the right is a tall pitcher with a light brown coffee](image.png "You've gotta love a terrifyingly tall pitcher balanced on a thin wooden board. Super fun to carry back! lol")_Pretty presentation but I have yet to see a single other person order a pour-over while I'm there._

In one word: Variety. I've been to this cafe 3 times so far, and the relative frequency in which they rotate out their offerings is truly impressive! Especially since the quality of the brews hasn't fallen as a result.

They offer the full gamut of coffee options: drip, pour-over, and espresso. I've been pretty impressed by all of them, with some middling pour-overs mixed amongst some otherwise solid ones.

The bags are light brown, stamped with "Printer's Row Coffee" and varied colored stickers denoting the specific roasts](<image copy.png> "I regret not getting in closer to get a clearer pic with the text visible...")_I like their understated bag designs. Very sleek with simple charm._

They roast all of their own coffee, and while it's pretty good most of the time, I've had enough \*misses\* to discount them from my potential home-brewing rotation.

## Cafe

![Full view of the cafe seating. Many people are dispersed among small 2-top tables and couch seating with tasteful art and dracaneas placed around.](<image copy 2.png>)_Somehow I feel like this photo doesn't do the scale of this space justice._

A strong cafe that suffers greatly from success. This place rules, but unfortunately it doesn't handle large crowds very well. It gets quite noisy, and unless you're fully dialed in with work or a conversation, you'll find yourself quickly overstimulated by how much talking and movement is happening around.

Image is dominated by the large espresso machine and the origami pour-over cones near the forefront.](<image copy 5.png>)_I don't love the roaster sharing space, both for noise and quality reasons, but the setup overall is commendable._

However the space itself is well laid out and decorated tastefully. A great variety of tables and seating options, even some couches.\
I would not call this cafe "cozy"; it still definitely feels like a warehouse turned cafe (because it is), but I think they've done a respectable job with it.

## Price

Prices are on the better end of things for Chicago, but nothing to write home about. I'd judge that you're getting fair quality for value here.

| Drink Type (12oz) | Price (USD) |
| -------- | --------- |
| Drip     | $3.25     |
| Latte    | $5.50     |
| Cortado  | $4.25     |
| Americano| $3.50     |
| Mocha    | $5.50 (unsure about syrup add-on price)|
| Black Tea | $3.50 |

## Productivity

![Angled photo of the front door from the register line. The big door + windows on the right letting in light. On the left 3 people sit and talk on the couch. There are coffee beans in the foreground.](<image copy 6.png>)_Didn't get great pics of the crowds, but trust me they're always there_

Few outlets, a precious few coveted "big work tables with outlet access", and consistent noise and distraction make this a poor contender for the work from (not) home aspirant.

The tables themselves are solid, and the wifi seems consistent, but "vibes" wise it's difficult to get things done, and you do NOT want to take any calls here.

Personally I struggle to do any drawing or reading here, but I've had success with web development.\
I rank this cafe as a social-first space. Perfect for meeting a friend or more, especially in-between shopping if you're in the area for that.

## Vibes

![View towards the front door from seating at a large rectangular table. The window to the left lets in the majority of light. There is a lot of open floor space, an empty table, and then the coffee counter at the back.](<image copy 3.png> "Might be on of the best clandestine cafe photos I've yet taken lol. Lighting be crazy.")_When it's emptier it feels genuinely warm in here. Still too large for "cozy" but definitely warm._

The vibes are first set by the location. This cafe is located just south of a major commercial area of the near north side. Notably a very _car-oriented_ shopping area. I'm genuinely surprised by how many people visit this cafe because walking in this area is discouraged by the development, and this is at the southern fringe, just past a huge REI retailer.

Inside, it's warm, not cozy, but ultimately welcoming. I don't get a strong impression of how this cafe fits into the neighborhood or hyper-local community, but again it's hard to judge when it's surrounded by industrial and heavy-commercial development.

Additionally, the cafe is busy enough that I don't foresee myself forming any lasting bonds with the staff–there is always someone to serve, something to do, etc. and the hectic feeling gives the coffee-bar side of the cafe a palpable (but reasonable!) tension.

I don't want to judge too harshly though because I've still only visited maybe 3 times so far, and they rotate out enough unique drinks and unique events that I feel like they're trying harder than I've been able to discern so far.
