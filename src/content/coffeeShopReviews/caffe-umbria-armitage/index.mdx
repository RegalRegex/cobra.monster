## Coffee

Mediocre at best, generally pretty sub-par. I've had their light roast as drip and really enjoyed it, but it isn't consistent. Their espresso is typical Italian-style dark roast without much complexity to it. However the chocolate they use in their mochas (and that they give as squares with your drink) are among my favorite types of dark chocolate, and ultimately works pretty well.

## Cafe

Super cool. The majority of the space is their roastery, and during the week they *will* be roasting there, so be prepared for loud noise and probably a hotter cafe.\
The fact that their roasting equipment is just open to the air of the cafe, including the often-busy entrance door wafting in whatever temperature air is outside is certainly a choice.

## Price

$2.77 for a 12oz single-origin drip is impossible to beat. Other coffee drinks are fairly priced.

## Productivity

Great productivity vibes here. Plentiful spacing, and many outlets available for use. High tables have especially courteous outlet routing for good access. Generally quiet, good wifi.

## Vibes

Feels like community, and feels like a safe space. Staff seem to enjoy the space, and their joy + the wall art make the place feel lively and local.
