summary: A California roastery transplanted into a Chicago neighborhood. Feels anodyne and unserious, but wants to be taken seriously. Possibly good coffee, but yet to be impressed. Weird amount of fake plants juxtaposed to genuinely decent real pothos so idk what's going on
orderSuggestion: Latte with any syrup
location: Bridgeport, Chicago
scoreOnly: true
notChicago: false
