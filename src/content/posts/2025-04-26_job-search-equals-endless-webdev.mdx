After 3 months of building this site, having to immediately build another is a real drag, not gonna lie.

Honestly I'm not sure what my plan was because I was never going to be able to use this site to advertise myself to the wider job market. I was always destined to make a more anodyne "marketable" professional site ðŸ¤®

No regrets though!!

# More Astro...Yay?
The new site is made with AstroJS again, and originally only took 5 days to make and deploy. It was nice and simple...but then I started watching some [Dev Portfolio Site roasts](https://youtu.be/aUJiNyb3cvM?si=eVRqT4BZ78t-nKQQ) ðŸ˜¬ and suddenly I didn't feel so confident about the quality of mine :(

I had a night of *freakout* where I kind of stressed myself about meeting par but I fortunately calmed down and dug myself out of that YouTube-inspired doom mentality and took stock of what I could actually do to **reasonably** improve my site:
- Moving content off of page links and all onto the front page
- Smooth scroll
- Dark/Light Mode
- 508 Accessibility
- Adding a work experience/education section
- Updating resume to match industry standards
- Taking my fursona off of the site (it really wasn't as subtle as I thought)

## An end in sight...! Maybe!
Fortunately I think I'm getting fully burnt out on "for fun" website design, so with these changes I think I'll be satisfied with where I'm at.\

And then comes the actual job search lmao.

It won't be bad since I'm not urgently searching, and I have ~8 years of experience now. But even still it makes finishing these cool website projects feel a bit bittersweet.

Anyways. I can't share the full site, but here's more-or-less what I've got going. You can definitely tell it's made by me!
