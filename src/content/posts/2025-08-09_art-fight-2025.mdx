# Real quick: what's art fight?

Art Fight is an annual event each July hosted on the Art Fight website. You can read the details from the site's [about section](https://artfight.net/info/about) if you wish, but the **TL;DR** is: it's a month-long competition wherein you score points for your team by drawing fanart of other peoples' characters, scored based on level of *finish* (rather than subjective quality).

<span slot="caption">This goofy piece on the left I made last year in about an hour was scored at a whopping *192 points*, compared to just *38.5 points* for the painting on the right which I spent upwards of 4 hours on.[^1][^2]</span>

This "finish, not quality" approach means that Art Fight is a fantastic opportunity to let loose! Try new things...but most importantly, just chill and not obsess over each and every piece you make.
