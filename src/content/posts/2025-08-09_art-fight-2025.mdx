# Real quick: what's art fight?

Art Fight is an annual event each July hosted on the Art Fight website. You can read the details from the site's [about section](https://artfight.net/info/about) if you wish, but the **TL;DR** is: it's a month-long competition wherein you score points for your team by drawing fanart of other peoples' characters, scored based on level of *finish* (rather than subjective quality).

<span slot="caption">This goofy piece on the left I made last year in about an hour was scored at a whopping *192 points*, compared to just *38.5 points* for the painting on the right which I spent upwards of 4 hours on.[^1][^2]</span>
</AccordionPhotoTemplate>

This "finish, not quality" approach means that Art Fight is a fantastic opportunity to let loose! Try new things...but most importantly, just chill and not obsess over each and every piece you make.

And this is not a small event. There were **602,781** registered active participants this year![^3]

# 2025 Art Fight Season

This season was Crystals vs. Fossils, and at time of writing the winner hasn't been declared yet, but I'm confident that my fellow Fossils pulled out the win <InlineEmoji emoji="triumph"/>

As with every year though, I ultimately don't really care about the competition. The point is the art, and the fun of surprising people with art!

## The Art!

I put out *15* pieces this season! My most ever >:3 and I'm proud of each of them!!

Below I'll be including each of the 15 pieces, plus some thoughts as well as what I feel is strong and weak about each piece.

Also! If this piece is a revenge or has a revenge piece associated with it, I'll share that in an Accordion :3

> "Revenge" in Art Fight refers to an art piece ("attack") made in response to one someone has received.

### 1. Person

![Green and white cat anthro riding a white bike in front of a stylized explosion background](@assets/myArt/artFight2025/Person.jpg)

My first attack was for my cool local friend [Jasper](https://bsky.app/profile/somepersonover.bsky.social), of their fursona, "Person"! I wanted to do something fun and full of action, but I was *gripped* by the desire to draw them on their brand new bike! Because it's so cool and so very ~~they/~~*them.*

Yes, I certainly decided to draw an entire bicycle for my first effort-agnostic art event drawing...What can I say, an idea is an idea!

Proud of:
1. Perspective
2. Lineart
3. Vibe

Room for improvement:
1. Foreshortening
2. Shading
3. Anthro cat faces/anatomy

### 2. Alaska
![Bust of a female grey cobra wearing a green cavalier hat and wielding a rapier.](@assets/myArt/artFight2025/Pavlentine.png)

For my second piece, I wanted to do something painterly and dramatic! So I honed in on Pavlentine's Alaska, a cool rapier-wielding cobra!

I was a little rushed because although Art Fight just started, I would almost immediately have to set it down to go to Anthrocon in Pittsburgh.\
That being said, I think I did a pretty good job! I painted in color mostly on a single layer, and I'm pretty pleased with how the face came out :3

Anyways make sure to check out [Pavlentine on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/pavlentine.bsky.social) b/c they have a really cool pixel art style and obviously a very cool cobra OC <InlineEmoji emoji="smirk" />

Proud of:
1. Paint texture
2. Expression
3. Eye

Room for improvement:
1. Values
2. Metal texturing
3. Scale textures

### 3. Jeh Jeh Rocket

![Stylized orange and yellow Charizard anthro character, gesturing with foreshortened hand towards the viewer. He is reclining on a beach setting, shirtless, and generally muscular.](@assets/myArt/artFight2025/Jeh&#32;Jeh&#32;Rocket.png)

Jeh Jeh Rocket was on my list from last year, and honestly he's just a cool, hot, buff scalie character and I liked his vibe.

Tried some new stuff, and generally not fully proud of the result...but I am proud of myself for trying some ambitious Foreshortening and posing, and especially proud of myself for calling it *done* even though not perfect.

Jeh Jeh Rocket belongs to [GatorFruitt](https://bsky.app/profile/gatorfruitt.bsky.social)!

Proud of:
1. Head/Neck anatomy
2. Hands
3. Simple beach background

Room for improvement:
1. Anatomy confidence
2. Foreshortening dynamicism
3. Shading

### 4. Pinecone

![Anthro male deer character, eyes closed, wearing a green shirt, hugging a plushie My Little Pony Rainbow Dash plush item in front of a simple background](@assets/myArt/artFight2025/Pinecone.jpg)

This might be my most personally-significant piece this year because this is for a good friend I'm finally re-connecting with after almost 10 years. [Pinecone](https://bsky.app/profile/pineconethedeer.bsky.social) has just recently more fully joined the furry fandom, and most impressively, took me up on my suggestion [to do art fight](https://artfight.net/~PineconeTheDeer)!!\
I've linked his Art Fight above but if you don't have an account to view them, I need to share a few of his here:

<Accordion client:visible>

My man did ***20*** attacks in his first ever Art Fight and they're all tremendous! These 2 might be my overall faves though:

</AccordionPhotoTemplate>

I think it's both funny and cool that he focused so hard on deer characters since his fursona (and only oc at the moment) is a deer! He told me he just tag-searched for deer until he found one he wanted to try drawing. Very Real.

But of course, he also did me the incredible honor of attacking me back for drawing his deer by drawing *Argent!*

<AccordionPhotoTemplate numImages={1} numCaptions={1}>
<div slot="image">

</AccordionPhotoTemplate>

I'm just so delighted and impressed by him. I can't wait to see what else he does! :3
</div>
</Accordion>

With that context, this piece kind of speaks for itself. The Rainbow Dash plushie is a nod to our shared Brony past, and the fact that not only is she best pony (according to him üíé) but he actually sewed his own RD plush all those years ago!\
It felt like including a nod to that here was a way of sharing enthusiasm for his continued creative drive and growth, especially as he continues to find new ways to express himself :3

Proud of:
1. Pose
2. Plushie design and texture
3. Hands

Room for improvement:
1. Deer anatomy
2. Antlers
3. Emotional expression of face + eyes

### 5. Persn

![Egregiously muscular green and purple dragon thingy with floating eyeball dots](@assets/myArt/artFight2025/Persn.png)

Listen.

Playing PEAK with [Jasper](https://bsky.app/profile/somepersonover.bsky.social) got us in a silly mood and I came up w/ the idea to draw something just terrible of their Art Sona...? Brand mascot...? Unclear.

Most of the joke is the thumbnail.

![thumbnail of the above image, but just the simple head](https://images.artfight.net/attack/th_yAY6EUpPLDJKa5eIryIDTftSeLdBdCgXMCoY7tWU9tBSirxOf4ueKvRdwi92.png?t=1752468875)
_This is what anyone on Art Fight sees until they click and see the full image...I think it's hilarious lmao._

But yeah idk Persn is just a really cool goofy character, and I genuinely love them a lot. And I wanted to be a little evil and use my disgusting muscle furry art powers to turn them into a monster.\
Success.

Proud of:
1. Muscle!!! <InlineEmoji emoji="triumph"/>
2. I'm fucking hilarious
3. Wings look pretty good ngl

Room for improvement:
**N/A**

### 6. Harley Klawz

![Grey, white, and black anthro werewolf woman with 4 ears, growling and gesturing towards the viewer in front of an abstract background](@assets/myArt/artFight2025/Harley.png)

I think this might be my greatest triumph this season. I am woefully inexperienced drawing:

- Fur
- Werewolves
- Intense emotions, poses

And yet! I feel like I kinda pulled it off! It was so important to me that I made a proper revenge piece against my friend [Harley](https://bsky.app/profile/harleyklawz.bsky.social), and I pushed through the "oh god I don't know how to draw werewolves" dread and put out something I'm really proud of :3

Proud of:
1. Hand pose
2. Textured shading/hatching
3. Simple efficacy of facial expression

Room for improvement:
1. Hair volume, texture
2. Wolf teeth/mouth
3. Clothing

A revenge piece for the undisputed _raddest_ Argent piece I got this year...! I saw this super cool cyborg scalie with _zero_ attacks and knew I had to break that terrible trend <InlineEmoji emoji="triumph"/>

Had a lot of fun with this piece though I did spend way too much time researching revolvers and getting the pose right...worked out in the end though!

[Hammond](https://bsky.app/profile/hammondaloo.bsky.social) has a ton of cool characters and he popped the fuck off with Art Fight this year. And not just because he attacked me with _TWO_ pieces this year...! Scoundrel!

Proud of:
1. Lizardiness
2. Coloring
3. Revolver

Room for improvement:
1. Pose is a bit stiff
2. BG way too boring
3. Hands feel funky

### 8. Sammy

![Navy blue and orange-yellow Protogen character headshot](@assets/myArt/artFight2025/Sammy.png)

I spent a lot of Art Fight this season searching for cool Protogen characters to attack, and honestly really struggled. Fortunately [Genziao's](https://artfight.net/~Genziao) Sammy character managed to break through the fog and offer me something really fun to draw!

I don't know why but I gravitated towards a fancy headshot this time. And I'm most happy about how great it looks from a reasonable distance. Up close there's a lot of roughness...but it works! :3

Proud of:
1. Cleanness of final piece
2. Coloring and blending
3. Tasteful background and headshot crop

Room for improvement:
1. Glassiness of Protogen mask
2. Hair color, texture
3. Lineart cleanliness

### 9. Sarc

![Two overly simplified chibi representations of Argent (anthro cobra male) and Sarc (grey female kobold with a huge head crest)](@assets/myArt/artFight2025/Sarc.jpg)

I feel a little bad because I was drawing this literally across the table from [Sarc](https://bsky.app/profile/llllsarcllll.bsky.social), who themselves was finishing an _incredible_ attack against me...It's goofy, it's silly, it's fun, and still I feel like I should've done something higher quality for a friend like her.\
But! It's still art, and unlike random folks on Art Fight it's always socially acceptable to draw for your friends :3

Anyways, not a lot to say about this shitpost piece but I had a lot of fun drawing Sarc as a wretched little creature :3

Proud of:
1. Shitposting style
2. Tasteful Tits
3. Goofy poses

![Retail clothing scene with Argent and Donny (snakes) in the foreground. Argent clearly struggling to fit in a hoodie. In the background another snake, Cy, struggles to stuff his hood through the hoodie hole](@assets/myArt/artFight2025/Donny.png)

I knew at least once I had to draw a #SnakeSquad pic, so I chose [Donnie's](https://bsky.app/profile/komodonnie04.bsky.social) namesake snake, as well as [Coatl's](https://bsky.app/profile/featheredsnek.bsky.social) Cy!

Donnie is drawn with such cool, fresh fashion that the idea of "Argent isn't fashionable" immediately came to mind. Not long after I got the "Cobra hoods would make hoodies tricky" idea and the rest just came outta that.

Very pleased with this one! Good art skill but also quick and cute with a pretty functional background scene to boot :3

Proud of:
1. Background quality + efficacy
2. Expressions/posing
3. Overall art quality

Room for improvement:
1. Pushing goofy poses/expressions further
2. Clothing details to depict stretch and bad-fit
3. More snakes

### 11. Raspberry

![Vague kelp forest background. Foreground is a goofy ribbon eel, mega-lengthened for comedic effect.](@assets/myArt/artFight2025/Raspberry.jpg)

Every year I draw something for my [lovely girlfriend](https://bsky.app/profile/tropicoastal.bsky.social) because 1. I love her but 2. and most importantly, she has _fantastic_ characters.

Raspberry is one of my absolute favorites. He's just a silly little guy!! And I wanted to be _very_ silly with him. So I sat at my favorite bike + coffee shop and banged out this funky piece.

I'm really quite pleased with how well I illustrated his curvy ribbony body, especially with keeping the colors accurate!

Proud of:
1. His cute face
2. The ribbon shape, and curvature
3. Those funky lil legs

Room for improvement:
1. Better "kelp forest"
2. Goofier, cuter face...
3. Smoother coloring + shading

### 12. Ott Hiemnal Valentine

![Painterly portrait of an abstract Dragon god with a floating laserdisk halo.](@assets/myArt/artFight2025/OttHimnel.png)

Probably my _magnus opum_ for this year. I spent probably close to 8 hours total on this piece across 2 weeks. Ott's design is just incredibly fun and cool, and I felt inspired to really push my painting skills.

This piece is actually my first attempt at a value-painting attempt. Everything painted in greyscale until layering color overtop. Very grateful to my friend [Orion](https://bsky.app/profile/koboldorion.bsky.social) for offering their assistance. I would not have pushed my values nearly far enough without their input!

Also just grateful for [Bean's](https://bsky.app/profile/scrumptiousbean.bsky.social) insane OC he is SO COOL augh. Inspiring just looking at him!!

Proud of:
1. First values-painting attempt!
2. The hands
3. The final product, esp with framing

Room for improvement:
1. More confident shapes
2. Darker darks!
3. Planning/Posing

### 13. Noodle & Bean

![Very simplified bean cat and noodle snake in 4 varied Chicago tourist vignettes: Sears tower, Chicago hotdog, The Bean, and riding the L](@assets/myArt/artFight2025/Noodle_Bean.png)

I found [Casual Bean's](https://bsky.app/profile/casualbean.bsky.social) delightful OC collection, thanks to my friend Pinecone who drew Noodle earlier. After the painting effort of Ott Hiemnal, I really wanted something goofy and fun!

The Chicago theme kinda fell into place, I think this piece started just as a cute napping piece, but the thought:

_...bean....bean....Chicago..Bean...Chicago Bean!!!_

hit me like a truck and I had to go with it lol. Just a lot of goofy fun with this one :3

Oh and yes I _did_ figure out how to import the special ligatures fontface for the Chicago Star (just like the rest of my website) as well as the official Big Shoulders typeface just for that title card haha.

Proud of:
1. The 4 scene ideas
2. Simplified Sears Tower
3. Letting loose and not over-engineering

Room for improvement:
1. More confident simplified shapes
2. Goofier expressions and poses
3. Better hotdog drawing skills

### 14. Diamondback
