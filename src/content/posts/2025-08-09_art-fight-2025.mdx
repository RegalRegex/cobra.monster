# What's Art Fight?

Art Fight is an annual event each July hosted on the Art Fight website. You can read the details from the site's [about section](https://artfight.net/info/about) if you wish, but the TL;DR is for one month you can score points for your team by drawing fanart of other peoples' characters.

It's an excuse to stretch your drawing wings a bit and draw for folks you may not even know! Personally I use each Art Fight event as an impetus to try some new techniques, or to try drawing characters I'm not normally drawn to (e.g. non-scalies).
