# Real quick: what's art fight?

Art Fight is an annual event each July hosted on the Art Fight website. You can read the details from the site's [about section](https://artfight.net/info/about) if you wish, but the TL;DR is for one month you can score points for your team by drawing fanart of other peoples' characters.

Importantly, art submissions are self-scored according to level of finish, rather than some arbitrary "quality" (eg. drawing vs sketch. Shaded vs unshaded. Etc.), so there's no pressure for perfection! You can totally stop at just the sketch and call it done :3

And yet...! Gripped by the throat by perfection and maximalism...

It's an excuse to stretch your drawing wings a bit and draw for folks you may not even know! Personally I use each Art Fight event as an impetus to try some new techniques, or to try drawing characters I'm not normally drawn to (e.g. non-scalies).

And this is not a small event. There were **602,781** registered active participants this year!
