For the first time in a very long time, I feel like I've got the whole summer ahead of me, mine for the taking. And I'm not sure what to do with it!

# Summers of Yore

The last few years have kind of sucked for various reasons, or have just been busy in Not Fun ways.\
Last year I spent most of June visiting family, and even had a weekend with friends out on the lake. It was a great time, but I spent a *full month* away from Chicago during what I quickly learned is the BEST time to be in Chicago 🙄

_To be fair, it's a pretty good time to be at a lake too._

# The Game Plan

On the docket for this summer so far:

- 🦊 Anthrocon 2025
- 🏟️ See a Cubs game (I haven't been to a baseball game since I lived in St. Louis a decade ago!)
- 🏙️ Architecture riverboat tour with parents
- 🍗 Bristol Ren Fair
- 🚴‍♂️ Bike rides (especially Critical Mass)
- 🎨 Art Fight (not really a traditional Summer Activity™ but it's always during July...)
- 🏳️‍🌈 Pride Parade!

## A bit of a reset

Most of what I'll be doing though is relaxing. With my job search and my Spring spent working on this (and other) websites, I haven't had much time for my other hobbies. I haven't drawn a thing a since December,[^1] and I'm very behind on my reading.

> Hopefully soon after posting this blog post, the new <TextDeco url="/books/default">Books section</TextDeco> of my website will be done :3c\
Be sure to check it out if you want to see what I'm reading, and what I've read!

I'm also hoping to grind out the last 5% of body fat from my current cut diet. As of time of writing I'm at ~17% and the goal is 12% by the end of August. Probably can do it sooner! But we'll see...cutting like this is so difficult. Gonna have to resist a lot of good summer cookout food 🥲 ~Maybe I should give Sardine Summer a shot huh~

## Argent Real

With a goal of "finished by Anthrocon", probably the coolest thing I'm doing this summer is turning into IRL Argent 👀

Just look at those shapes!! That's SNAKE!! That's me! Wrwow.

Thanks for reading! If you have any cool Chicago summer activity ideas please <TextDeco url='/links#socials'>let me know 👀...</TextDeco> I'm still new enough to the city that I know I haven't even scratched the surface here.
