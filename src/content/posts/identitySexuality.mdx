Despite some very strong signs in hindsight, I had no idea I was queer until my mid-20s, but here we are.

# A Work in Progress
I don't have a lot to say here, really. I've considered myself gay and/or queer for a while, but only recently have I started to *consciously* dig into that much more. I think like many folks, I felt "inadequately queer" compared to my peers.

A very cis-male presenting cis-male in tech who dated girls as often as guys...it felt like "queer" wasn't my scene. But I'm finally fixing that.

## Self-Love
Aside from career anxiety, I never struggledd with self-confidence. I did my own thing, enjoyed what I liked, and dressed comfortably and casually in a way that felt suggested little more than "this guy can match colors alright". But friends and therapy have brought that into refocus for me; I still have room to grow in self-love, even if I feel overall "content" with things.

The biggest thing I've started playing with lately is makeup and outfits! Shaking things up just a little to simply **think** about this aspect of my life more.

# Gay/Queer/Bi/Pan
Labels are tricky in the LGBTQIA+ community. I mean it's easy to respect each others' but it's hard to pick one (or a few) for yourself with confidence.
- I consider myself **Bisexual**, but I don't personally see a meaningful difference between Bisexual and Pansexual for *me*
- I refer to myself as either **Gay** or **Queer** interchangeably, depending on the converation and vibe

# Polyamory
I used to consider myself polyamorous, but due to being taken advantage, and not fully understanding what polyamory meant, I don't feel comfortable with that title anymore. Someday I may revisit it with my partner, but until then I feel that my non-polyamorous relationships are benefiting from my current efforts.

<EmojiBlockquote emoji={redBook} size="emoji">Jessica Fern's <a href="https://www.jessicafern.com/books">Polysecure</a> was a godsend in freeing myself from a lot of confusion and indecision, and I cannot recommend it strongly enough to anyone.\
Monogamous, queer, straight...it doesn't matter. It's a universally-applicable treatise on understanding your romantic motivations and how you handle relationships (both positive and negative).</EmojiBlockquote>
