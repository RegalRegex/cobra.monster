[Onyx Coffee](https://onyxcoffeelab.com/), a 3rd-wave roaster HQ'd in Arkansas, has always had the best packaging and presentation in the game. I was never too impressed by their coffee offerings, however. But I think that may have changed.

<EmojiBlockquote emoji={smile} size="emoji">

This blog post is first just me praising how pretty and cool Onyx's presentation is, but the meat and potatoes is going to be my ratings of all the coffee :3

I took off-the-cuff notes every day that I tried one of the coffees, and in honor of their honesty and out of respect of current-me's time, I'm just going to reproduce them here verbatim.

# What is Coffee Advent?

Other roasters and providers have done this before, but it seems as though Onyx is the most recognized (or perhaps the best at marketing it).\
In brief, Coffee Advent is 24 different coffees for each of the 24 days of December preceding Christmas. Each bag is 2oz of coffee, and the idea is that every day you brew a completely unique coffee from the day before.

It's a neat, simple idea. I think what really won me over was the combination of presentation and supporting media.

Obviously the packaging is fantastic, but what really sold me was the playing cards and videos that came with it. Two decks of playing cards, one a full normal playing deck with custom coffee motifs. The other a 25-card deck hosting 1 card per coffee offering with the coffee info, a description, and a QR code to the website and accompanying videos.

_They're high-quality too! Genuine Bicycle playing cards!_

They had a special website for this event and I have some _opinions_ on how it's coded. Thematically very cool. And neat that the cards match the physical cards I actually got with the package. Neat! The coffee nerd in me just wishes that throughout the event I'd had easier access to the \*information* itself

But I digress.

_Figures that it took til I recorded this in January 2026 for the site to actually work w/o a hitch_

I don't digress actually what the fuck. I couldn't reliably open this on firefox, or safari. I had to open it on a chromium browser just to get it to fucking work.

It's a wobbly reactive app with a spread of cards for each day and I hate it. Trying to swipe between cards on mobile just made safari freak out and change tabs and stuff. Sucks.
<br/>
Like my guy, this is cool design but if it doesn't WORK then I hate it. Bad UX kills cool UI.
