# Urbanism

# Biking
Now living in Chicago, I'm an avid biker. But I think like many Americans, I didn't really have much of an opportunity earlier in life due to the suburbs being what they are.\
After childhood bike rides I never touched a bike until my family won one in a contest at our gym and I took it to college with me.

Biking on campus ruled.

Bike parking on campus sucked. (It got stolen)

## Bikes
Currently I've got two bikes: My 3-speed **Fyxation Pixel 3** and my **Vvolt Centauri 2** E-Bike. I started with the Pixel 3, and then two years later got the E-Bike.

### Pixel 3

I love this bike. I spent a good amount of time with a local friend, checking out a cool local bike shop and getting this bike mailed to and built there! Immediately put on a chain guard, rack, and better saddle.

This thing is so zippy and nice. It's my first bike since college, and not a lot has changed but one big thing are the availability of internal gear hubs. I have the [Shimano Nexus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimano_Nexus) 3-speed, and unlike a traditional derailleur, I can change gears without pedaling.\
Riding 3rd gear up to a stop sign, stopping, and switching to 1st gear before starting up again. It's so convenient! Very worth the trade of not having many more gears.

> Springing for a 3-speed in Chicago was a pretty dang easy choice too. The topography here pretty comfortably fits within just those 3 gears. 

### Centauri 2

I imagine that most folks buy e-bikes because they have a specific need. Or perhaps they live in a hilly city that makes biking tricky...\
Amidst my many-months of research for my e-bike I think I struggled to try and justify it but I ultimately concluded that I just \*wanted\* it. It's **a cool toy** and useful vehicle that I just wanted for "sometimes!"

#### Things I Love About It
This bike is special. Even among e-bikes there's just a lot about this particular company and model that makes it stand out.
- **Automatic-Transmission Internal Gearhub** - It's a 3-speed bike, but it shifts automatically as I pedal or stop. It took some getting used to, but it's a pretty novel experience not having to think about shifting
- **Torque Sensor + Middrive Motor** - The real luxury of this bike, in my opinon. These two components are what make this bike keep its identity as a "bicycle" to me. There's no throttle, you MUST pedal, and when you do, these components are going to make you feel like a superhuman (depending on the assist level)
- **Hydraulic Disc Brakes** - Not unusual on an e-bike but since my manual bike has calliper brakes it's like night and day. These hydraulic brakes have already saved my butt at least twice since getting this bike
- **Overall Design Language** - I'm insane about that integrated headlight...the way it leads seamlessly into the "thin-for-an-e-bike" downtube. It just feels unique and elegant!
- **The Screen** - I actually really love the control screen. It's got a nice color UI but I'm especially pleased by the variety of statistics you can toggle! I can even track my own Watt Hours energy output. That's rad
- **The Company** - Vvolt is just 6 employees, apparently. And every time I've reached out for clarification over chat-bot or calling in, I've gotten a human on the other end who can barely contain their excitement for their product. That's just really cool. Communication was good and they genuinely seem like a rad group of people making something unique.
