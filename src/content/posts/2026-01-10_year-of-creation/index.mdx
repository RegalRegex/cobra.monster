This is my first New Years with a blog, so I think it's only fair to make a corny "year of [goal]" post! I'm going to lay out my gentle goals for the year, and then check in on them later this year :3

# Cooking More

Very simple but the very first thing I want to focus on this year is cooking more AND eating out less. I already eat pretty healthy, even when I eat out at least half the time is at someplace nominally "healthy".
