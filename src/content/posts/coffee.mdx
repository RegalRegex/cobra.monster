Mmm coffee. I've been into coffee since early college days, and have only grown more serious about it as time goes on.
Scroll on for my latest coffee sourcing & prep recommendations--towards the bottom I'll share my gear and #CoffeeJourney

# Recommendations
These change over time, but I consistently look for top-tier consumer-level roasters, equipment, and techniques.
## Types of Drinks
In order, my favorite ways of preparing coffee:
1. Pour-over (\*ceramic\* V60 or Origami dripper)
2. Espresso (espresso, macchiato, cortado, cappuccino or small americano)
3. Aeropress
4. Turkish
5. Drip
## Roasters
In no particular order:
- [Proud Mary](https://proudmarycoffee.com/) *Melbourne, Austin TX, Portland OR* - One of my first big finds. Great coffee, but they sell coffee in 250g (8.8oz) bags for the same price as you can get 12oz elsewhere.
- [Olympia Roasters](https://www.olympiacoffee.com/) *Olympia WA* - Best quality for value. Best source I've found for 3rd-wave quality coffee but at approachable prices.
- [Black & White Roasters](https://www.blackwhiteroasters.com/) *South Carolina* - They have the funkiest, most diverse offerings. They change up often though, so you likely won't find the same thing twice.
- [Dayglow](https://dayglow.coffee/) *Los Angeles CA* - Highest quality on this list, but priced as such.
# My Setup
At home I currently have a Wayfair-quality baker's table with all my coffee (and tea) things on it.

## Major Gear
- **Lelit Victoria Espresso Machine** - Single-boiler home espresso machine with PID temperature control
- **Niche Zero Grinder** - The original "what if home grinders were good" beast of a grinder
- **Stagg EKG Eletric Kettle** - Wworkhorse kettle with a design I'm embarrassed to like as much as I do
- **Acaia Lunar Scale** - Recent gift from the lovely gf. Crazy expensive for a scale but super nice
- **GC Water** - That 1-gal plastic pitcher is more than it appears. I buy distilled water and treat it with [GC Water coffee](https://www.globalcustomizedwater.com/) treatment chemicals. I'm *that* level of serious lol

# Coffee Journey
## Auspicious Beginnings
Dual-major college nerd needs caffeine to stay up late; there's a Starbucks inside the Student Memorial Union building...white mochas tasty!
## The Crisis
Starbucks kinda sucked when it was made by minimum wage college students, but also it got real expensive real fast.
## Salvation
I started venturing out into downtown, and testing out coffee shops there. Most of the shops were either chains or just kinda um. Bad. BUT one day I noticed a sign in an alleyway advertising a new shop: **Shortwave Coffee**...went inside, and met the then-owner Dale.

Dale was super cool. I actually recognised him from another coffee shop where he used to work bar (on the espresso machine). I explained that I was trying to get more serious about coffee, but didn't know where to start. He said he'd help me out, and he poured 3 different fancy coffees for me to try.\
At the time I didn't like black coffee, and even then didn't love those...but talking to him, I was able to taste the "notes" he talked about. It was the first time I'd actually tried multiple coffees together in a "flight" like this.
> This happened in 2013 or so. I asked about Dale the last time I visited, but he no longer owns the shop.\
I'm grateful for  his kindness and hope he's doing well.
## The Grind
Since then it has been a series of trials and error in finding the right equipment, techniques, coffee...etc.
### The Equipment
I'm pretty pleased to say that I've stayed true to the *"Buy Once Cry Once"* mentality, and have bought high quality equipment just one time, and never had regrets.\
I do have a bunch of ancillary coffee brewing equipment that I rarely use, like my Vietnamese Phin or my [Bripe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tltBHjmIUJ0). But these are truly novelties, and if not a gift, they were reasonably cheap.
### The Beans
This is the most active aspect of my coffee journey at the momentâ€“I'm constantly finding new varietals and funky flavors to try. I'm especially searching for GOOD decaf because drinking caffeinated coffee late into the day is just impossible.
### The Shops
Ask any of my close friends and they'll tell you how crazy I am about going to coffeeshops. A true *perkalurker* I like to bed down at a coffee shop for hours at a time to work, draw, and vibe.
> A **"Perkalurker"** is one who sets at a coffee shop by spending the minimum requisite "buy-in" (usually just a cup of drip coffee) and stays there all day, taking space and spending little. [^1]\
I do not do this. I spend time conscious of how busy it is, and tip consistently etc. Treating the space as a the treasured [Third Space](https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/24119312/how-to-find-a-third-place-cafe-bar-gym-loneliness-connection) it really is.
