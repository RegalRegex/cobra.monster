Another coffee tour! This time, of the **Pilsen** and **Bridgeport** neighborhoods Southwest of the Loop. I picked a Saturday and a friend, and made the 50min bike ride in the brisk November Autumnal morning, and headed down to two neighborhoods I've barely yet visited.

And unlike my [last coffee tour](/blog/2025-09-06_uptown-edgewater-coffee), I've built some things on my website to streamline this process a bit :3 Enjoy the commentary but feel free to scroll down to the quick-n-dirty summary + scoring for each one!

They're in the style of my full [cafe reviews](/cafe-reviews), just probably without a dedicated page.

# The Map

![Google maps screenshot of the Pilsen and Bridgeport areas, showcasing a custom cafe list](map.png 'ignore the url at the bottom this was a lazy quick screenshot and Im far too lazy to change it now')
_The goal was for somewhere both bikeable AND accessible by transit in the future_

# The Outing

## Anticonquista

![A blue notebook labeled Anticonquista Cafe Family Farm Owned and Operated Coffee Roaster atop a green and blue woven mat beside a yellow plate with a brown cylindrical pastry](image.png 'crazy how well this low-effort picture turned out')

The only shop on the trip today that I'd already visited, Anticonquista Cafe was high on my list to re-visit, especially with my friend.

As a coffee snob, I wasn't overly impressed with the quality of coffee this time or last, but it was *good*, and more importantly, I am in love with their mission and the politics of their shop.

![Orange wall featuring anticolonial posters and political buttons](<image copy 2.png> "I don't have a favorite but I love all of the 'US OUT OF [country]' ones. Very hype.")
_They really don't make agitprop like they used to!_

As a huge proponent of combatting white Western chauvinism, places like this are a precious goldmine of accessible education and perspective.

![A hand-made ceramic mug filled to the brim with coffee on a small table beside a bluetooth speaker](<image copy 23.png> "Great mug! way too much coffee hogugh")
_Never seen a handmade mug like this at a cafe_

I enjoyed my coffee, though it was yet another shop that gave me this^ when I asked for a small, 8oz americano so. I don't know what's up with that.\
Solid though! Not mindblowing, but genuinely very comfy, tasty coffee.

![Close-up photo of the "Song of the people" written in Spanish on the left, English on the right. It is a story about the death Tecún Umán of the Maya by colonial violence, and how "The Quetzal will only sing again when its people and land are truly free"](<image copy 4.png> "Beautiful")

This place is utterly unique. It doesn't fit in to my tidy "work from home" coffee shop paradigm, but it feels cool being there, and engaging with an honest business with a genuine anticolonial foundation. Very rad.

## Cup of Joe - Pilsen

![Extreme angle photo of the Cup of Joe coffee house. A white brick building with large reflective glass underneath the store name. On the right side is a Mexican candy skull decal that says "Welcome to Pilsen 60608"](<image copy.png> "Strategic 'I dont want to look like a creep' angle lmao")

This place really surprised me! It's a very small space, so it clearly serves as a tidy "grab food + coffee and go!" purpose in the area, but honestly the food and coffee were surprisingly good!

<EmojiBlockquote size="emoji" emoji={smirk}>
Yes, a 5/10 is a "surprisingly good!" coffee by my ratings lol. I'm pretty decent at avoiding BAD coffee, so my rating system scales down.
</EmojiBlockquote>

![Photo of a glossy menu board, with the cafe's signature skeleton character (with steaming espresso cup head) pouring a cuppa](<image copy 5.png> "I looove their mascot barista guy")

Really cute branding and pretty dang solid pricing overall!

![Full shot of the cafe. People are standing ordering coffee on the left, and seated at the sparse cafe seating in the front and right. The wall is covered with Mexican art and photos of old cars](<image copy 3.png>)
_This is the WHOLE cafe, minus the bar seating at the window_

I enjoyed my Americano, and the vibes were very nice. Not exactly a place to hunker down and get some work (or website coding) done, so I probably won't be back unless I'm meeting an acquaintance nearby.

## CTRL Z

![Full view of Ctrl Z cafe. Many people are seated at various unconventional seats throughout the cafe. A large, yellowing plant dominates the foreground. There is a bike hanging from the ceiling. The coffee bar is in the back.](<image copy 6.png> "We gotta look into this 'hanging bikes from cafe ceilings' trend what is that about" )
_This is the entire cafe, save for 4 window bar-seating spots to the right_

Ctrl Z might be the biggest disappointment of the trip, but I don't think it's hopeless. I took the barista's recommendation for a type of drink (the name of which I've forgotten), and it amounted to a very roasty, mid-tier pour-over.\
Not *bad* but I'd heard a lot of good things about this place so...

![Black and white menu board with a security camera at its base on the shelf. To the bottom right are a bottle of water and glass bottle of coke](<image copy 7.png>)

Incredibly competitive prices, so big fan of that. They offer a wide enough array of flavors and options that I feel like I could easily bring most friends here and find them something they'd like. 

![Coffee merch shelf. There are 6 bags of coffee beans on the mid and bottom shelves. The top shelf has 2 handmade purple mugs with steam baskets beside each one. An old school camera is in the center.](<image copy 8.png>)
_All medium roasts...hmmm_

I'm fast learning that there are a good many high-tier, Southeast Asian specialty coffee shops. Love the ubiquitous *ube* syrups they all offer (ube is so so good, y'all), but also they tend to source/roast very interesting beans!

![Photo of a variety of uncommon coffee brewing equipment, including 3 prominent cold-brew drip towers on the right. There is a pour-over station in the front. In the back are other glassware and coffee accoutrement](<image copy 9.png>)
_The could brew things are pretty rare, but invariably in my experience indicate a serious coffee shop_

They're clearly serious about their preparation. And it's still pretty tough finding a good pour-over in this town, so I plan on coming back. The drink I got on this trip just wasn't super impressive!

![Focused photo of a blue car door built into a table stand with 4 black stools with wooden stool toppers](<image copy 10.png> "Still confused why they thought this was a good idea like yeah it's cool but it's a terrible terrible table")
_Points for creativity lol but I couldn't sit here long_

Interesting space with interesting coffee options...deserves a 2nd chance. Not super accessible by transit, but that's why we've got bikes!

## Bad Owl Coffee Roasters

![Front view of the cafe. White medium-large sized tables in the foreground to the left, bar seating to the right, and a coffee roaster in the back. The back left is the coffee prep bar with people standing in line.](<image copy 11.png> "I knew what I was getting into with this, gonna be real honest")
_Absolutely NOT a hoot_

Ho boy. Hooo man.

First off we gotta talk about the roasting machinery situation. I'll refer to my rant in the [Caffe Umbria review](/cafe-reviews/caffe-umbria-armitage#coffee), but TL;DR any coffee roaster with their machinery out in the open like this is *not* serious.\
On a more specific note here, what the hell is the deal with the two bar seats just facing the roaster?? If that thing is running anyone there is going to get *blasted*. Plus it's so loud!

Okay I'm ranting again. Moving on.

![Cafe entrance. Full glass panes with gold text reading the name of the shop](<image copy 12.png>)

I heard good things about Bad Owl (from reddit) but just from my maps sleuthing I could tell it was probably nothing too special.

![A "coffee flight". A serving board with 4 cortado-sized cups with 4 different coffee drinks, one of which is obviously espresso, the rest are a mix of foam and milk.](<image copy 13.png> "I love flights at like, craft beer places so I thought this'd be fun...eh.")
_Cute._

Full coffee flight review below, but suffice to say I was not impressed.

<Accordion client:visible>
<span slot="title">Coffee Flight Review</span>
<div slot="content">
I talked to the barista, told them it was my first time here and wanted to order something that'd really show me the value of Bad Owl. They thought for a minute, and then recommended this coffee flight.\
It had:
- Espresso
- Cortado
- A banana nut latte cold brew (apparently they're really popular)
- A non-coffee drink they likened to "butter beer"

The espresso was OK. At tasting I told my friend "it's the pinnacle of average medium-roast espresso", as in, (generously) it's just about as good as you can get from unremarkable espresso.

The cortado was awful. Just awful. The milk was flat, and the espresso tasted empty.

The banana thing was like, fine. But I don't care about sweet cold brews so I'll be neutral on that.

The butter beer thing was tasty because it was a sugary non-coffee sweet drink. Again, not coffee, so /shrug.

_There's just something suspicious about that gecko..._

I wish I could say I love their coffee bags because at first glance they're very pretty and cool!\
But I can't shake the feeling that they're made with AI art...and I just don't trust that.

![Side view of the coffee roaster behind thin plexiglass standees, adorned with fake vine plants](<image copy 15.png>)
_Why put it in the middle of the floor, but then "hide" it with cheap plastic plants?_

The vibes are off. The coffee is off. I don't really know who this is for, but at the very least not me.

## Jackalope Coffee & Tea House

![Eclectic cafe busy with colors and prints, buttons, and other decorations all over the walls and countertops. Espresso prep space is in the background. The front of the counter has a prominent jackalope logo on a red circle background](jackalope.png)

The final stop on our little coffee tour, this was absolutely the overall highlight for me.\
- Pretty dang good coffee
- Interesting media and trinkets everywhere you look
- Tons of space, and rooms of different volumes/activity
- Community board games

It has it all!

![Wall covered in framed posters, predominantly of animals in various graphic and cartoony styles](<image copy 16.png>)
_I think I spent no less than 10 minutes just craning my neck looking at things_

There's a lot I look for in a cool cafe. Coffee, sure, but also places that I'd enjoy taking my friends to! And Jackalope really feels right.

![View of a black-painted wall covered in various tapestry and framed art. A doorway is visible to the left into more cafe space.](<image copy 17.png>)

![A pink and blue wall in the cafe space. More art on the walls, wooden tables in the foreground with vintage booth seating](<image copy 18.png>)

I don't have a whole lot more to say about the cafe that the pictures don't say for me. It's just neat! And I'm serious, the coffee (and pistachio donut we got) was really really good!\
Not 9/10 good, sure but I'm picky...and picky as I am, that regular-ass americano was no less than a 7/10!

![Orange wall with a prominent Jackalope bust next to a full-body Mars Attacks! alien figure braced against the window](<image copy 19.png> 'I kinda yelled when I saw it. Loudly. It was embarrassing')
_Mars attacks!! Iconic af!_

# Closing Thoughts

This was even more fun than the previous coffee outing, partly because I biked, but also I think I just found cafes more representative of their respective neighborhoods (with the one exception), and that made a big difference.

## Just Northside Things

Chicago is a historically segregated city, and only the delusional would suggest it isn't still struggling with that history.\
As a somewhat-recent transplant to Chicago (2022) and as a communist who lives on the wealthier, whiter Northside of Chicago, how do I contend with that? What do I do to both resist the chauvinist, alienating effects of that material reality?

I don't have a great answer to that. But I feel that the *lowest* hanging fruit would be to visit and engage with the other neighborhoods in the city. And I strongly believe that community coffee shops are an excellent stepping stone for an outsider to mingle!

![Exposed bricks with shelves hosting anticolonial literature for sale in Anticonquista cafe](<image copy 20.png> 'more cafes should sell books fr fr')
_So many great books here. I nabbed that copy of The Red Deal!_

For someone on the Northside, what would bring you all the way to Pilsen or Bridgeport? For the average person, probably either a special event or friends.

And I suppose that's true for me too. I first visited Pilsen a few months ago when South Loop friends took me on a bike ride from the loop over to **Anticonquista**. Ever since then I'd been trying to come up with a good excuse to travel over there.

## A bit of the local fabric

Cruising through a few streets between coffee shops is hardly a thorough exploration of a neighborhood but it really planted a seed in me. I have two good coffee shops worth coming back to, but I also have countless sights of things I biked past that my friend and I called out–things worth another visit.

![A reflective glass storefront to a local art gallery and print shop](<image copy 21.png> 'if you squint you might see the gay-ass kink art on the walls uwu')
_We briefly stopped into Hoofprint here to check out the art :3_

Biking down 18th St in Pilsen was a joy, passing all the vibrant Mexican-American art adorning the shops and restaurants along the street.\
Crossing the bridge over to Bridgeport, almost missing *Ctrl Z* coffee shop for how simply it slotted into an old factory building...things like that really stuck with me.

I'm proud to call Chicago my home, and I've only ever been rewarded for exploring outside my hyperlocal sphere and seeing what else the city has to offer, and how all my cool neighbors live and support one another with hot brews and cool spaces UwU

![A white travel cup of coffee with black lid on a wooden counter in front of a window at Cup of Joe Pilsen](<image copy 22.png> 'woaw cofee')
_Comfort in simplicity...also still thinking about the really cool black & blue e-bike my friend and I saw while at Cup of Joe. @ that cyclist: hiiii thanks for chatting with us your bike is sick I hope I wasn't too weird asking questions about your e-bike I just thought it was neat_
