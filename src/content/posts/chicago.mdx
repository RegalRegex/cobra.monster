I haven't been here long, but it doesn't take long to fall in love with Chicago. So much to see, do, and enjoy. All while sharing a city with the nicest Midwestern neighbors I've ever had.

# Why Chicago?
Most of this falls under my <TextDeco inline={true} url="/about/urbanism">Urbanism interest</TextDeco>, but suffice to say Chicago has a lot to offer to someone who loves a friendly & diverse city, and hates feeling like he \*must\* drive to get around.

## The Chicago L

I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that the L (our elevated heavy rail public transit system) is probably what drew me here. For someone who has only ever lived in car-oriented suburbs (looking at you, San Antonio), the immense scale of Freedom and Ease of movement that the L offers is unparalleled.\
And unlike many subway systems, much of the L is Elevated! Useful public transit that lets you look at your city as you go. Incredible.

# Moving to Chicago
Thanks to remote-work, I decided I needed to get out of San Antonio, TX ASAP. After a lot of research, Chicago was the clear winner for me. I moved here in 2022, and (due to complex relationship things at the time) initially ended up in River North for a year.

Fun fact! Living in River North sucks! Don't do it!\
Unless you're made of money, it's nearly a food desert, and what isn't "Tourist" just feels like rich person facade nonsense.
<br />
It's a lot of money for very little Chicago. Definitely visit though!

I'd never move back to River North but it was an OK place to land when you knew nothing about the city. As I'd hoped, being close to <TextDeco inline={true} url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Loop">The Loop</TextDeco> meant easy access to the rest of the city via public transit, and I was able to explore enough to eventually realise that I wanted to live elsewhere in the city.\
There is only one thing I miss about living in River Northâ€“the view:

## Elsewhere
I've moved further up northside since then, though I spend a lot of time in West Town since there are so many great coffee shops in the area.\
I'll likely continue to move around the Chicago area, but I doubt I'm ever leaving. Each neighborhood has something great to offer ~~River North excepted~~.
