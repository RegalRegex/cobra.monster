# Some Background

I'm obviously a pretty big [coffee nerd](/about/coffee), and if you follow me online you know I talk a lot about the cafes I like to visit. I hadn't been in Chicago long before I'd scoped out all the best shops...judging from a purely "where's the best Coffee" perspective.

> ["Best Coffee" list here, btw! :3](/about/coffee#best-chicago-coffee-shops)

But there's more to cafes than just the coffee, and I think it's high time I put more effort into appreciating them. A good cafe is the avenue into the heart of its neighborhood...so today I chose a neighborhood (well, a few) and scoped out the cafes beforehand.\
The goal was simple exploration, but the added hope was finding new places good to meet friends at--especially for drawing or doing work together :3

## The Map

![Screenshot of Google Maps with a custom list pinning coffee shops](./map.jpg)
_Posted to [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/coffee.cobra.monster/post/3ly5fqhepn22u "Thank god I don't care enough to embed the map or something wacky") the night before_

I started out just googling around on Maps. Fortunately with the 4 new Red Line CTA stations open, it was going to be super easy to use them to get around pretty quick. And turns out there were a lot of cafes near the stations!

## Rating System

Going to keep this simple and rate things out of 5! Quick explanation:
- **Coffee** = coffee quality _relative_ to just this trip only! (Spoilers but none of these shops served as high quality coffee as my regular haunts)
- **Cafe** = the physical space itself, size/layout and especially seating options
- **Price** = rated based on quality of what was served. 5/5 means you're getting a steal of a price for what they're offering
- **Community** = how much the cafe feels like it's a unique part of its neighborhood, as opposed to 'just another coffee shop'
- **Vibes** = subjective overall "how likely am I to return and possibly bring friends here"

# The Outing

I decided to start at _pHlour Bakery,_ and then figured I'd hop from place to place, getting a cup of coffee from each, taking a few pictures, then choosing where to go next. Trying to hit up as many places as I reasonably could.

I also invited two friends to come with me. After an info mixup ("Meet me at *Berwyn* station" was mixed up with *Bryn Mawr*), we got started!

## pHlour Bakery

![Dining area pHlour bakery](./IMG_6566.jpg "Wonder how busy it gets?")

While not a cafe, pHlour fits into the scene by being a very prolific pastry supplier *to* cafes across the city. The fact that their main bakery happened to be next to the Bryn Mawr station just made it a really convenient starting place for my little trip.\

![Tomato-Basil danish and blueberry scone on a plate](./IMG_6569.jpg "Don't talk to me about scones I'll talk your ear off")
_mmm scone_

I got there at opening, so I had the pick of the litter. I got myself a tomato-basil danish, and a blueberry scone. The Danish was really savory and nice, and the scone was incredible. I love scones, and this is easily in the top 3 I've ever had! <InlineArgentEmoji emoji="smile"/>

> **Coffee: N/A** only ordered food\
**Cafe: 2/5** simple, but clean and pleasant enough\
**Price: 3/5** pretty much exactly what you'd expect\
**Community: 1/5** as they are mostly a supplier to other cafes, inside dining is minimal\
**Vibes: 2/5** totally fine, just not really a hangout place. Get your stuff and walk next door to the train

![Neon sign on a wallpapered wall that reads "pro gluten"](./IMG_6568.jpg "I had finished my danish and was halfway through the scone before I looked up and saw this. Definitely an early morning.")
_Sent this to my gluten-free parents and they got a real kick out of it_

## Sip & Savor

![Photo from the back of Sip & Savor looking outwards. There's bar seating to the left, and many small 2-person cafe tables to the right and elsewhere](./IMG_6571.jpg "Couldn't take a GREAT pic w/o including way too many random strangers.")
_I'm trying to figure out what this space might've been before a cafe, but I can't quite nail the vibe_

What's the opposite of "starting things off with a bang"? Maybe "tripping at the starting line?" In any case, **Sip & Savor** is all that and more (less?).

I'm being dramatic, but it wasn't a good start when I asked the barista for a macchiato and he said:

"Uh hmm...I don't think we have a **button** for that."

![Argent Whine](@assets/argent/stickers/babanasaur/whine.png "no mean me!!")

A button!! That means...they use a super-automatic coffee machine! Aaaa....dang. Now I know I'm a coffee snob at heart, but I'm chill and polite, so I asked the barista for his suggestion, and got an americano. He told me it'd be a medium-dark roast, and that they couldn't do my preferred 8oz size so...yeah. (It was really bad)

<EmojiBlockquote emoji={argentUwu} size={'sticker'}>
Super-automatic espresso machines are awesome, by the way. Especially for home, but I don't disagree with them in some commercial settings! There's a lot to be said about having a programmable "press one button and get a specific type of latte/cappuccino" machine, especially in a high-volume environment. They're just not for me :3
</EmojiBlockquote>

![Cafe back, showing booth seating and couches around a natural-wood coffee table](./IMG_6570.jpg "Genuinely very nice area. Couch just kinda sucked.")
_The back of the cafe is pretty nice at least._

The cafe itself was overall solid though. A lot of space, and good seating options. They even had some couches (a rarity at my usual coffee shop locations), but I wasn't impressed by the comfort, honestly.

They do have a tv running a loop of Animal Crossing videos though...!

![wall-mounted tv with some animal crossing visuals playing](./IMG_6573.jpg 'A little wretched')
_I genuinely like this, though it felt kind of out of place_

> **Coffee: 1/5 ** burnt and unremarkable americano with too much water\
**Cafe: 3/5** good variety of seating, but the space feels too big for what's being offered\
**Price: 3/5** pretty much exactly what you'd expect\
**Community: 3/5** the signboards were cute and had personality, and the space felt reasonably tailored to the area\
**Vibes: 2/5** just like, fine! Nothing special or really notable

## The Lost Hours

![Front view of the cafe. Pastry shelves are visible with chalk boards and shelves in the back.](./IMG_6578.jpg "Do y'all appreciate my high-effort 'minimize people + their faces in the frame' techniques?")

I had high expectations for this place, based purely on [their website](https://www.the-lost-hours.com/), which has some of my favorite design decisions I've ever seen on an otherwise-polished site:

![Front page of the website, with prominent text in the background reading "Time to escape" behind a glass with espresso](./timetoescape.gif "You have no idea how long it took to get a fucking gif to work on this site lmao")

![Section titled "flavor to savor" with 3 photos beneath, a coffee mug labeled "Worth every drop", a barista "Artista Baristas", and a pile of croissants "Pastry Pleasures"](./lostHours2.png "I can only aspire to become an artista barista myself...!")
_Just fantastic._

I'll cut to the chase: the coffee was pretty bad, but the cafe itself hit every other mark possible.

So you walk in, and the cafe immediately feels like a community space. It was comfortably busy, and super cozy. The cafe has that kind of variety of comfy-cozy seating that tells you that not only did the cafe prioritize comfort over aesthetic, but that they likely engaged with the community to source the furniture in the first place.

![Two brownish armchairs in the sunlit front of the cafe](./IMG_6576.jpg)

![Side area of the cafe, with a complex shelf with books and coffee supplies](./IMG_6575.jpg "I know the pictures aren't great, but I didn't want to make folks uncomfortable :3")
_I didn't get better pictures than this, but there are many more tables and couches!_

Very cool. As for drink, I took my barista's recommendation and ordered a sweet latte drink...it was *$7.00* and consisted of espresso, chai, and various syrups. It was an overwhelming sweet mess, and demonstrations the classic Cafe Syrup Issue.

<Accordion client:idle>
<span slot="title"><InlineEmoji emoji={iceCream} /> Cafe Syrup Issue (small rant)</span>
<div slot="content">
The **Cafe Syrup Issue** is what I call it when I find a cafe that has tons of flavor syrups *and* specifically leans heavily into them as a standout feature of their coffee quality.

This is from a cafe I visited during a roadtrip:

![Cafe photo prominently feature a massive chalkboard with an enormous list of "recipes"](./syrupCafe.png)
_The chalkboards are just lists of syrup combinations..._

I understand that people can find these kinds of drinks tasty, but to me it just isn't coffee anymore. It's a sugar drink with coffee as a convenient caffeine source. Nothing special, and with very few exceptions, no artistry involved.

And to be clear, neither *The Lost Hours* nor any of the cafes on this list today are *THAT* bad. There's an element of this issue, but it's much much worse elsewhere I assure you.
</div>
</Accordion>

Apparently they source their coffee from local roaster, [Happy Monday Coffee](https://happymondaycoffee.com/), which popped up in my initial search but I quickly moved past mostly due to the fact that they only sell coffee blends and no single-origin coffees.

However I knew it'd be unfair to
