# Some Background

I'm obviously a pretty big [coffee nerd](/about/coffee), and if you follow me online you know I talk a lot about the cafes I like to visit. I hadn't been in Chicago long before I'd scoped out all the best shops...judging from a purely "where's the best Coffee" perspective.

> ["Best Coffee" list here, btw! :3](/about/coffee#best-chicago-coffee-shops)

But there's more to cafes than just the coffee, and I think it's high time I put more effort into appreciating them. A good cafe is the avenue into the heart of its neighborhood...so today I chose a neighborhood (well, a few) and scoped out the cafes beforehand.\
The goal was simple exploration, but the added hope was finding new places good to meet friends at--especially for drawing or doing work together :3

## The Map

I started out just googling around on Maps. Fortunately with the 4 new Red Line CTA stations open, it was going to be super easy to use them to get around pretty quick. And turns out there were a lot of cafes near the stations! 

# The Outing

I decided to start at _pHlour Bakery,_ and then figured I'd hop from place to place, getting a cup of coffee from each, taking a few pictures, then choosing where to go next. Trying to hit up as many places as I reasonably could.

I also invited two friends to come with me. After an info mixup ("Meet me at *Berwyn* station" was mixed up with *Bryn Mawr*), we got started!
