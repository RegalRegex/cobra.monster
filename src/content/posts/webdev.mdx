_woah so meta_

WebDev is a weird one for me because it's definitely something I'm passionate about, but it's also my \*job\*. I'm pretty confident that aside from blog posts and random updates to this site, I won't have any notable projects to talk about as I'll shift back to my other hobbies (especially drawing).

# Brief Glossary for Non-Developers
In lieu of a Marx and Engels-length footnotes section, I'm just going to frontload a few terms for anyone who isn't in da biz.

<Accordion client:idle>
<span slot="title">Glossary of Tech Terms <Image src={laptop} alt='laptop' class='max-w-6 inline-block'/></span>
<div slot="content">
## General Terms
- **Frontend/Backend** - General terms of convenience for talking about what part of a website/application/system someone or something touches.
- - Frontend - What the end-user sees. This is the "Website" as you see and interact with it. It has visual designs, and if it's running on a browser, it is 100% HTML, CSS, and Javascript at that point. **Python, Javascript,** and **PHP** are examples of Front-end coding languages.
- - Backend - Boiled down, this is "server stuff". It's the part of the app that takes information from the Front, and processes it to interact with servers. **C++, Java,** and **C#** are examples of Backend coding languages.
- **Framework** - This refers to a "library" or some other package of code that wraps around a coding language. **React** is a Javascript Framework, for example. **Django** is one for Python, and **Laravel** for PHP. Frameworks give new tools and convenience to developers while ultimately compiling back down into that simple language
## Languages
- HTML - "Hypertext Markup Language", the bones of websites. If you see things written in tags `<p>Like This</p>` you're probably looking at HTML
- CSS - "Cascading Style Sheets" is how you style HTML to make text bigger, add colors, do animations...everything! It's pretty cool but a little bit clunky.
- Javascript - Named "Javascript" specifically to benefit from the market share popularity of "Java" (they are otherwise unrelated). It's the âœ¨browser magicâœ¨ language that lets you do fancy things like "remember my login" and complex animations and movement. Mostly it's notable for allowing an app to take input from the Website or Frontend and pass it back to the backend for more processing and fancy logic.
## Frameworks
- **React** - The most popular Javascript framework today. It was originally made by Facebook, and its key feature is that it lets you write HTML inside of Javascript.

# The Quick 'N Dirty
Trying to avoid making this feel like a resume, but here's a quick list of the types of things I use/do under the "WebDev" umbrella:
- **React & Angular** - I started with Angular, learning at work, and then taught myself React doing some side projects
- **AstroJS** - This is new! It's what this website is made with. I'm instantly a big fanâ€“gives you all that freedom of ReactJS without the bloat of irresistable state logic silliness
- **HTML, CSS, and TailwindCSS** - I really like classic HTML/CSS development. My previous "professional" site was made with 99% vanilla HTML and CSS just to see if I could. But I included Tailwind (new as of this website) because yeahhhh. With component-driven development it just makes life so much easier

# 2017 Origins
Folks are often amused and confused when I tell them that my bachelors are in Biology and Religious Studies. Turns out there isn't a lot of work for those!\
While living in Seattle and working a very disappointing office job, I spent my freetime learning how to code.

> Just like the tech bros said I should! ðŸ™ƒ

I tried to learn Python but hated it so much. Starting at 0, a loose scripting language where you need to read whitespace was just so unintuitive for me. I ended up starting with C# insteadâ€“s/o to university night class certificate programs!

<EmojiBlockquote size="emoji" emoji={argentSmirk}>
Since earning that C# certificate I have never once coded in C# lmao. I got hired for it, then ended up doing Java instead (since they're nearly the same) and just never went back. Oh well!

## Backend to Frontend
The rest of my "story" isn't all that interesting. I spent a few years doing Java[^1] development for a company, and then had the opportunity to switch projects and do Angular[^2]. I really liked Angular, and enjoyed that project!\
In my free time at home I taught myself React[^3] specifically because I kept hearing how "hot" it was as a job skill. Turned out I liked it a lot too.

[^1]: **Java** is a very old + generally stable coding language. Today it is almost-exclusively used for "backend" things like handling user interactions with servers. Java and Javascript are not the same thing.
[^2]: **Angular** is Google's Javascript framework. Its key feature is allowing Javascript code directly inside of HTML.
[^3]: **React** is Facebook's Javascript framework. It's kind of the opposite of Angular in that it encourages you to code HTML inside of Javascript.
