If you've gotten this far it should probably come as little surprise to learn that I'm a furry. I've been fandom-adjacent for a while, but since 2017 or so I've considered myself a part of the furry community.

# What is Furry?
You can definitely find better explanations <TextDeco inline={true} url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furry_fandom">elsewhere</TextDeco>, but very generally, it's a global community of folks who love anthropomorphized animals and often represent themselves in online (and offline!) spaces via a personal "fursona" character.\
The appeal varies from person to person, but a strong throughline that attracted me and many of my friends is how overwhelmingly **Queer** the furry space is. The world is a complex, sometimes-scary place, and having a community where you're encouraged to design your exact preference of appearance, gender expression, etc is the perfect welcoming place to discover your real self.

## What is it to me?
More than anything it is a means by which I can interact with the world and meet interesting, compassionate people. Furries are cool! And diverse as heck. Literally the only thing that initially binds us is our love for anthro animals and exploring our sense of selves through that love.\
I owe a lot to the furry fandom. I've met countless friends and romantic partners through it. Discovered new passions and hobbies, and I'm constantly learning neat things from people I would otherwise never have the chance to talk to.

# Fursona
A fursona is one's personal anthro animal they use to represent themselves with. For me, that's my cobra Fursona, <TextDeco inline={true} url="/fursona">Argent</TextDeco> (he/him):
<Image src={ArgentSheet} alt="Argent Sheet"/>_Art by me :3c_

I designed him in 2019 with the help of some friends, and since then his design has changed very little. He's more-or-less "me as a King Cobra" with cool gold stuff and a bit more buff ðŸ’ª

<EmojiBlockquote emoji={ArgentThink} size="emoji">This is a general overview; more specific info about Argent can be found on the <TextDeco inline={true} url="/fursona">Fursona Page</TextDeco>!</EmojiBlockquote>

Like many furries, I have multiple Original Characters ("OCs") other than my fursona. I'm hoping to make a dedicated page for them sometime in the future :3
