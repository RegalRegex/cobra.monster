Read below for the full details, but the TL;DR of the "vibes" problems at Pedestrian are:

1. Treatment of unhoused and downtrodden
2. Labor concerns
3. Poor macro-business decisions trickling down

### "Undesirables"

Likely due to the proximity of the large L station, a lot of unhoused people come into the shop and there's no getting around how uncomfortable it is seeing cafe staff usher people out. Especially during the winter months.\
I get that there's some level of "we live in a society" there, but I think the thing that really bothers me is that they don't first offer the person a drink or at least a day-old pastry from their discount basket.

Feels like a cynical "we don't want to set a standard for giving away free stuff" approach, stilting the cafe against the local community who absolutely would not see that and think "oh shit I can just get free stuff", but instead would see it as a reasonable "ah that person is going through some serious shit. Glad my local cafe is trying to help a little".

IDK. I'm not a cafe owner, but I'm also not a capitalist and feel like training your staff to treat the most downtrodden of our society with a modicum of kindness and support is both easy, and better for the health of the cafe & community.

I stand by all this, even as someone who actually had two people **try to rob him** at this cafe lmao!

Two guys, acting very shifty, were scoping out the cafe late into the afternoon, and ultimately tried to distract me and swipe my stuff. It didn't work, due to them being so obviously shifty that not only was I skeeved, but another patron was watching them like a hawk and yelled aloud to scare them off when they started their shit.

That sucked but petty crime (attempts) like that are still reflections of our shit capitalist society. Don't further punish other folks just because some are desperate (and stupid) enough to try shit like this.

### Labor Concerns

To preface, I believe things are improving, but in the past I've heard disappointing things about how the cafe is staffed. Namely that folks are underpaid, overworked, and their scheduling desires & needs are not respected.

I believe it was early 2024 or maybe late 2023 when things came to a head. A few of staff entertained the idea of forming a union, but the rest of staff just jumped ship, and the shop was sent into turmoil.

There was a period through 2024-early 2025 where staff turnover was so high that it became uncomfortable going into the shop. Not only because I suddenly didn't recognise anyone at the cafe I was a regular at, but also because the stream of brand-new baristas were *not* good at making coffee, and I'm not going to pay for low quality coffee and weird semi-scab behavior.
